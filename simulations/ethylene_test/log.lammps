# Angle Coeffs: type K theta0
# User Params: Angle Strength = 60.
# Targets: H-C-H = 117.5, H-C=C = 121.3
# Since we only defined ONE angle type in the converter, we have to pick one equilibrium angle.
# This is a limitation of our simple converter.
# We will use an average or the H-C=C value (121.3) as it is more common (4 vs 2).

# Note: This is an approximation. In a real simulation, we'd distinguish C-H from C-C single bonds.
# But for "Hello World" to show it runs, this is sufficient.
