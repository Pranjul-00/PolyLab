# Bond Coeffs: type K r0
# User Params: C-C/Single=100, C=C=147.
# Targets: C-H=1.087 A, C=C=1.339 A
bond_coeff      1 100.0 1.087  # Type 1: Single Bond (C-H)
bond_coeff      2 147.0 1.339  # Type 2: Double Bond (C=C)
bond_coeff      3 800.0 1.20   # Type 3: Triple (unused)

# Angle Coeffs: type K theta0
# User Params: Angle Strength = 60.
# Targets: H-C-H = 117.5, H-C=C = 121.3
# Since we only defined ONE angle type in the converter, we have to pick one equilibrium angle.
# This is a limitation of our simple converter. 
# We will use an average or the H-C=C value (121.3) as it is more common (4 vs 2).
angle_coeff     1 60.0 120.0   # Generic angle ~120 degrees

# Note: This is an approximation. In a real simulation, we'd distinguish C-H from C-C single bonds.
# But for "Hello World" to show it runs, this is sufficient.
